# BEsmarter-Help
This is a project of BEsmarter (Bayesian Econometrics: simulations, models and applications to research, teaching and encoding with responsibility), which is a team of friends from Medellin (Colombia), that promotes research, teaching and encoding of Bayesian Econometrics with social responsibility.

This is a Jupyter file that contains a basic theoretical framework of Bayesian Econometrics, and its implementation in R.
